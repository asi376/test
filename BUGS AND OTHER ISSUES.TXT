THERE ARE MANY BUGS AND PROBLEMS, BEWARE JORDAN.

Most methods do not really have exception handling. some do, but they're very basic.

Reading files does not account for random strings. it does sort of catch ints and other data types, but it doesn't do anything

When saving a file, I can't get rid of some of the commas for list that books are in. This will probably cause issues reloading text files.

it cannot stop duplicates from being entered

There's probably a lot more things that I can't remember at the moment. Think of it as a horrible easter egg hunt!
